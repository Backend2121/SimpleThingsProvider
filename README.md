Be CAREFUL while torrenting:

# Do i need a VPN?

Whether or not you need a VPN will differ based on what you're downloading, what tracker you're using and what country you live in.

A major AAA game is much more likely to be tracked than a shovelware title that costs $3 on the eShop.

Not every country has ISPs and laws that care about torrenting. When in doubt, assume your country has harsher laws to be safe.

Finally, the site matters. The chances of receiving an ISP letter while using a private tracker is much smaller than using a public tracker due to it being more work for copyright trolls to join private sites (and they have a smaller userbase than public ones). The effort isn't worth it for them when they can get more people more easily on other sites.
