# HOW TO INSTALL
Download "STP_Setup.msi", run it (smartscreen will probably block it), finish the installation by leaving everything as is and start downloading the Modules/Extensions you are interested in from the same page where you downloaded the Setup, extract the "STP" folder from the ".zip" file(s) inside your Documents folder and run STP!

As an example for the path:
C:\Users\{USER}\Documents\STP\Modules\SomethingModule.dll
C:\Users\{USER}\Documents\STP\Extensions\SomethingExtension.dll

# HOW TO USE
Just type whatever you want to search from the selected website (in the drop-down menu) and press search!

# Do i need a VPN?

Whether or not you need a VPN will differ based on what you're downloading, what tracker you're using and what country you live in.

A major AAA game is much more likely to be tracked than a shovelware title that costs $3 on the eShop.

Not every country has ISPs and laws that care about torrenting. When in doubt, assume your country has harsher laws to be safe.

Finally, the site matters. The chances of receiving an ISP letter while using a private tracker is much smaller than using a public tracker due to it being more work for copyright trolls to join private sites (and they have a smaller userbase than public ones). The effort isn't worth it for them when they can get more people more easily on other sites.
